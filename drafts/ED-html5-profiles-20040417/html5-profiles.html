      <p>This specification defines rules and guidelines for extending the 
      document processing rules for [[!HTML5]] documents. The specification of 
      the <code>profile</code> attribute in this document is designed to correct
      and supercede the definition of <code>profile</code> in [[HTML401]] and
      [[XHTML11]].

      The latest stable version of the editor's draft of this specification is 
      always available on the W3C CVS server. The latest editor's working copy 
      (which may contain unfinished text in the process of being prepared) is 
      also available.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The W3C HTML Working Group is the W3C working group responsible for this 
      specification's progress along the W3C Recommendation track.
      </p>

      <p>This specification is an extension to the HTML5 language. All normative
      content in the HTML5 specification, unless specifically overridden by this
      specification, is intended to be the basis for this specification.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
      The profile attribute was introduced in [[HTML401]] as a means to specifiy 
      the location of one or more meta data profiles. The attribute could 
      contain a space-separated list of tokens or URIs and was primarily 
      designed to extend the way User Agents processed the HTML document. 
      User agents could recognize the URI (without actually retrieving the 
      profile) and perform some activity based on known conventions for that 
      profile or dereference the URI and perform some activity based on the 
      actual definitions within the profile.
      </p>

      <p>
      While the mechanism to use the contents of the profile attribute
      was not defined in HTML401, processing the profile attribute was later 
      detailed by XMDP, [[GRDDL]] and ERDF in order to present 
      processing instructions for extracting semantics from attribute values 
      contained in the HTML document.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Specifically, XMDP clarified profile attribute processing, and introduced 
      a profile document format based on XHTML which authors could produce and 
      link to using the [[HTML401]] profile attribute.
      </p>      

      <p>
      The HTML5 base specification dropped the <code>profile</code> attribute 
      from the <code>HEAD</code> element.
      </p>

      <p>
      This document is an extension to HTML5 which provides both a more 
      thorough and rigorous definition of the profile attribute and 
      generalizes it to all elements for scoped indication of vocabularies 
      (similar to how the HTML5 RDFa document and the HTML5 Microdata document
      extends and adds to HTML5).

      <h2>The Profile Attribute</h2>
      <p>This specification defines a single attribute and the way in which
      the values of that attribute are to be interpreted when generating a
      list of URIs.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt><adef>profile</adef></dt>
        <dd>a whitespace separated list of one or more URIs, each corresponding 
        to a profile document.</dd>
      </dl>
      
      <p>The <code>profile</code> attribute is valid on any element in
      the document. When processing attribute values, each URI must be processed 
      left to right.</p>

      <h2>Profile Documents</h2>
      <p>
      Profile documents define and provide URLs for vocabulary terms, these
      vocabulary terms apply to the current element and all descendant elements.

      Need to add a way that microdata could use definitions provided by the 
      profile attribute without having to use full URLs in itemtype attribute 
      values for example.

      <p class="issue">
      Need to add an example using the profile attribute to 
      introduce/define/scope a vocabulary and then use in microdata, 
      microformats, and RDFa markup simultaneously, as a demonstration that they
      can be used on the same data in a complementary overlapping fashion. Not 
      sure of the utility of doing this but demonstrating that they can 
      be used in the same document or even on the same element may 
      help both alleviate incompatibility concerns, and how to use shared 
      vocabularies across multiple syntaxes.

      <h2>HTML 4.01 Errata</h2>
      <p>
      The HTML4 recommendation is inconsistent in its description of the 
      profile attribute:
      </p>

      <p>
      The DTD specifies <code>%URI;</code>, which just expands to 
      <code>CDATA</code>. On the other hand, the prose explains that
      <blockquote>This attribute specifies the location of one or more meta data 
      profiles, separated by white space. For future extensions, user agents 
      should consider the value to be a list even though this specification 
      only considers the first URI to be significant. Profiles are discussed 
      below in the section on meta data.</blockquote>
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Since the publication of HTML 4.01, a number of meta data profiles have 
      been defined, and many of them can be used in the same document. While 
      the profile attribute does not help in discovering which profile applies 
      to which part of the document, it does allow declaring which profiles are 
      in use, potentially triggering extended behavior in recipients.
      </p>

      <p>
      This erratum restores consistency in HTML 4.01, explicitly allowing 
      multiple URIs in a single profile attribute.

      Do we need to include XMDP interpretations of HTML 4.01 / XHTML 1.0.
