 <h3><dfn>Microdata</dfn></h3>

 <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

 <h4>Introduction</h4>

  <p>Sometimes, it is desirable to annotate content with specific
  machine-readable labels, e.g. to allow generic scripts to provide
  services that are customised to the page, or to enable content from
  a variety of cooperating authors to be processed by a single script
  in a consistent manner.</p>

  <p>For this purpose, authors can use the microdata features
  described in this section. Microdata allows nested groups of
  name-value pairs to be added to documents, in parallel with the
  existing content.</p>

 <h4>Attributes, APIs and Processing Rules</h4>

 <p>The Microdata attributes, APIs, Processing Rules and other normative
    specification text is defined externally
    in the Microdata specification 
    [<a href="http://html5.digitalbazaar.com/specs/microdata.html">MICRODATA</a>].</p>
