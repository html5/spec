    <h3>Drag-Drop Semantics</h3>

    <p>When a user agent is performing a drag operation, it must ensure
    that the following step is performed as a part of the drag operation:</p>

    <p>The user agent must take the <span>list of dragged nodes</span>
    and <span title="extracting JSON">extract the microdata from those
    nodes into a JSON form</span>, and then must add the resulting
    string to the <code
    title="dom-DragEvent-dataTransfer">dataTransfer</code> member,
    associated with the <code
    title="">application/microdata+json</code> format.</p>
