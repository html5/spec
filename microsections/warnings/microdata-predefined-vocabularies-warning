The issue surrounding the controversial nature of embedding complex semantic
vocabularies into any HTML specification is that there will always be 
many more vocabularies that are not included in the specification. Which
vocabularies should be included in the HTML5 specification? If semantic 
vocabularies are successful, one side-effect could be that the HTML5 
specification will grow to encompass twenty or more mainstream vocabularies. 
It can be argued that these vocabularies don't need to be included in the 
HTML5 specification to enjoy widespread usage. Why not place the vocabularies
in separate specifications?

One of
the counter-arguments to this line of reasoning is that HTML already provides
simple semantic vocabularies such as rel="stylesheet", rel="next" and other
keywords to express semantic information. Why not include more complex semantic
vocabularies? Discussions on including semantic vocabularies into the HTML5 
specification are ongoing.
