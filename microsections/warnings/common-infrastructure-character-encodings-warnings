This section seems to be providing normative language requiring 
<abbr title="User Agent">UA</abbr> manufacturers to not support certain
character encodings. The section also provides implementation advice,
as normative language, which would require a conforming HTML5 UA to 
violate currently published specifications.

While these "willful violations" of current W3C and IETF specifications 
are performed to ensure backward compatability for legacy content, the
act of violating known specifications is not good practice and must be
discussed in further detail with both the W3C and IETF. There may be a 
possibility to harmonize this specification with the specifications 
that are violated.
