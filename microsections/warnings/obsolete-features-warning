Statements regarding the summary attribute are under active discussion and 
do not enjoy broad consensus.

<p class="XXX">
There is concern that making the summary attribute as obsolete conflicts
with current guidance given via the
<abbr title="Web Accessibility Initiative">WAI</abbr> and the 
<abbr title="Protocols and Formats Working Group">PFWG</abbr>. Alternate
language for the summary attribute is currently being authored and may
replace some of the language related to summary in this specification.
This <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/32">
issue is currently being tracked</a> at the HTML WG.
