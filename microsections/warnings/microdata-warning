There will be a forthcoming HTML5+RDFa proposal that may either
be published along-side the Microdata specification or in place of the
Microdata specification. RDFa is a alternate technology that is 
currently published as a 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/">Recommendation via the W3C</a>. 
An additional alternative that is being proposed
is the removal of Microdata and RDFa from the HTML5 specification and
the placement of each section into a separate specification that is
implemented on top of the HTML5 standard.
