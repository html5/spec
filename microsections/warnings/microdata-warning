This section is under active discussion and does not enjoy broad consensus. 
The discussion surrounding whether or not to integrate RDFa or Microdata
into the HTML5 specification was started 
<a href="http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2008-August/015892.html">around August 2008</a>.

<p class="XXX">
There will be a forthcoming HTML5+RDFa proposal that may either
be published along-side the Microdata specification or in place of the
Microdata specification. RDFa is a alternate technology that is 
currently published as a 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/">Recommendation via the W3C</a>. 
An additional alternative that is being proposed
is the removal of Microdata and RDFa from the HTML5 specification and
the placement of each section into a separate specification that is
implemented on top of the HTML5 standard.
