  <p>An <code>img</code> element represents an image.</p>

  <!-- v2 ideas for <img>:

     * Maps sites would like to know which images are already cached,
       so that they can use images that are vaguely suitable while
       they wait for the most appropriate image to download.

       Almost like lowsrc="", except that many images might be
       appropriate.

       Slight hitch: their images are at a different origin, and we
       don't want to allow arbitrary cross-origin inspection (privacy
       leak risk).

     * See note at rel=noreferrer.

  -->

  <p>The image given by the <dfn
  title="attr-img-src"><code>src</code></dfn> attribute is the
  embedded content, and the value of the <dfn
  title="attr-img-alt"><code>alt</code></dfn> attribute is the
  <code>img</code> element's <span>fallback content</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code title="attr-img-src">src</code> attribute must be
  present, and must contain a <span>valid URL</span> referencing a
  non-interactive, optionally animated, image resource that is neither
  paged nor scripted. If the <i>base URI of the element</i> is the
  same as <span>the document's address</span>, then the <code
  title="attr-img-src">src</code> attribute's value must not be the
  empty string.</p>

  <p class="note">Images can thus be static bitmaps (e.g. PNGs, GIFs,
  JPEGs), single-page vector documents (single-page PDFs, XML files
  with an SVG root element), animated bitmaps (APNGs, animated GIFs),
  animated vector graphics (XML files with an SVG root element that
  use declarative SMIL animation), and so forth. However, this also
  precludes SVG files with script, multipage PDF files, interactive
  MNG files, HTML documents, plain text documents, and so forth.</p>

  <p>The requirements on the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
  attribute's value are described <a href="#alt">in the next
  section</a>.</p>

  <p>The <code>img</code> must not be used as a layout tool. In
  particular, <code>img</code> elements should not be used to display
  transparent images, as they rarely convey meaning and rarely add
  anything useful to the document.</p>

  <div class="impl">

  <hr>

  <p>Unless the user agent cannot support images, or its support for
  images has been disabled, or the user agent only fetches elements on
  demand, or the element's <code title="attr-img-src">src</code>
  attribute has a value that is an <i>ignored self-reference</i>,
  then, when an <code>img</code> is created with a <code
  title="attr-img-src">src</code> attribute, and whenever the <code
  title="attr-img-src">src</code> attribute is set subsequently, the
  user agent must <span title="resolve a url">resolve</span> the value
  of that attribute, relative to the element, and if that is
  successful must then <span>fetch</span> that resource.</p> <!-- Note
  how this does NOT happen when the base URL changes. -->

  <p>The <code title="attr-img-src">src</code> attribute's value is an
  <i>ignored self-reference</i> if its value is the empty string, and
  the <i>base URI of the element</i> is the same as <span>the
  document's address</span>.</p>

  <!-- same text in <input type=image> section and similar text elsewhere -->
  <p>Fetching the image must <span>delay the load event</span> of the
  element's document until the <span title="concept-task">task</span>
  that is <span title="queue a task">queued</span> by the
  <span>networking task source</span> once the resource has been <span
  title="fetch">fetched</span> (defined below) has been run.</p>

  <p class="warning">This, unfortunately, can be used to perform a
  rudimentary port scan of the user's local network (especially in
  conjunction with scripting, though scripting isn't actually
  necessary to carry out such an attack). User agents may implement
  <span title="origin">cross-origin</span> access control policies
  that mitigate this attack.</p>

  <p>If the image is in a supported image type and its dimensions are
  known, then the image is said to be <dfn
  title="img-available"><i>available</i></dfn> (this affects exactly
  what the element represents, as defined below). This can be true
  even before the image is completely downloaded, if the user agent
  supports incremental rendering of images; in such cases, each <span
  title="concept-task">task</span> that is <span title="queue a
  task">queued</span> by the <span>networking task source</span> while
  the image is being <span title="fetch">fetched</span> must update
  the presentation of the image appropriately. It can also stop being
  true, e.g. if the user agent finds, after obtaining the image's
  dimensions, that the image data is actually fatally corrupted.</p>

  <p>If the image was not fetched (e.g. because the UA's image support
  is disabled, or because the <code title="attr-img-src">src</code>
  attribute's value is an <i>ignored self-reference</i>), or if the
  conditions in the previous paragraph are not met, then the image is
  <em>not</em> <i title="img-available">available</i>.</p>

  <p class="note">An image might be <i
  title="img-available">available</i> in one <span>view</span> but not
  another. For instance, a <code>Document</code> could be rendered by
  a screen reader providing a speech synthesis view of the output of a
  Web browser using the screen media. In this case, the image would be
  <i title="img-available">available</i> in the Web browser's screen
  view, but <em>not</em> <i title="img-available">available</i> in the
  screen reader's view.</p>

  <p>Whether the image is fetched successfully or not (e.g. whether
  the response code was a 2xx code <span
  title="concept-http-equivalent-codes">or equivalent</span>) must be
  ignored when determining the image's type and whether it is a valid
  image.</p>

  <p class="note">This allows servers to return images with error
  responses, and have them displayed.</p>

  <p>The user agents should apply the <span title="Content-Type
  sniffing: image">image sniffing rules</span> to determine the type
  of the image, with the image's <span title="Content-Type">associated
  Content-Type headers</span> giving the <var title="">official
  type</var>. If these rules are not applied, then the type of the
  image must be the type given by the image's <span
  title="Content-Type">associated Content-Type headers</span>.</p>

  <p>User agents must not support non-image resources with the
  <code>img</code> element (e.g. XML files whose root element is an
  HTML element). User agents must not run executable code
  (e.g. scripts) embedded in the image resource. User agents must only
  display the first page of a multipage resource (e.g. a PDF
  file). User agents must not allow the resource to act in an
  interactive fashion, but should honor any animation in the
  resource.</p>

  <p>This specification does not specify which image types are to be
  supported.</p>

  <p>The <span title="concept-task">task</span> that is <span
  title="queue a task">queued</span> by the <span>networking task
  source</span> once the resource has been <span
  title="fetch">fetched</span>, must act as appropriate given the
  following alternatives:</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>If the download was successful and the image is <i
   title="img-available">available</i></dt>

   <dd><span>Queue a task</span> to <span>fire a simple event</span>

    <p>Otherwise, the element <span>represents</span> nothing, and may

    <p class="note">In a conforming document, the absence of the <code

    <p>If the image is not <i title="img-available">available</i> or

  <p>User agents may always provide the user with the option to

  attribute, when used on an element that is a descendant of an

  presence that the element provides access to a server-side image
  map. This affects how events are handled on the corresponding

  <div class="example">

   <p>A single image can have different appropriate alternative text

   <p>In each of the following cases, the same image is used, yet the
   <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> text is different each
   time. The image is the coat of arms of the Canton Geneva in
   Switzerland.</p>

   <p>Here it is used as a supplementary icon:</p>
   <pre>&lt;p>I lived in &lt;img src="carouge.svg" alt=""> Carouge.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Here it is used as an icon representing the town:</p>
   <pre>&lt;p>Home town: &lt;img src="carouge.svg" alt="Carouge">&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Here it is used as part of a text on the town:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>Carouge has a coat of arms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="carouge.svg" alt="The coat of arms depicts a lion, sitting in front of a tree.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is used as decoration all over the town.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Here it is used as a way to support a similar text where the
   description is given as well as, instead of as an alternative to,
   the image:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>Carouge has a coat of arms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="carouge.svg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The coat of arms depicts a lion, sitting in front of a tree.
It is used as decoration all over the town.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Here it is used as part of a story:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>He picked up the folder and a piece of paper fell out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="carouge.svg" alt="Shaped like a shield, the paper had a
red background, a green tree, and a yellow lion with its tongue
hanging out and whose tail was shaped like an S.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He stared at the folder. S! The answer he had been looking for all
this time was simply the letter S! How had he not seen that before? It all
came together now. The phone call where Hector had referred to a lion's tail,
the time Marco had stuck his tongue out...&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Here it is not known at the time of publication what the image
   will be, only that it will be a coat of arms of some kind, and thus
   no replacement text can be provided, and instead only a brief
   caption for the image is provided, in the <code
   title="attr-title">title</code> attribute:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>The last user to have uploaded a coat of arms uploaded this one:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="last-uploaded-coat-of-arms.cgi" title="User-uploaded coat of arms.">&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Ideally, the author would find a way to provide real replacement
   text even in this case, e.g. by asking the previous user. Not
   providing replacement text makes the document more difficult to use
   for people who are unable to view images, e.g. blind users, or
   users or very low-bandwidth connections or who pay by the byte, or
   users who are forced to use a text-only Web browser.</p>

  <p>When an <span>a</span> element that is a <span>hyperlink</span>,
  or a <code>button</code> element, has no textual content but
  contains one or more images, the <code
  title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attributes must contain text that
  together convey the purpose of the link or button.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example, a user is asked to pick his preferred color
   from a list of three. Each color is given by an image, but for
   users who have configured their user agent not to display images,
   the color names are used instead:</p>

   <pre>&lt;h1>Pick your color&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
 &lt;li>&lt;a href="green.html"><strong>&lt;img src="green.jpeg" alt="Green"></strong>&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>&lt;a href="blue.html"><strong>&lt;img src="blue.jpeg" alt="Blue"></strong>&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>&lt;a href="red.html"><strong>&lt;img src="red.jpeg" alt="Red"></strong>&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example, each button has a set of images to indicate the
   kind of color output desired by the user. The first image is used
   in each case to give the alternative text.</p>

   <pre>&lt;button name="rgb"><strong>&lt;img src="red" alt="RGB">&lt;img src="green" alt="">&lt;img src="blue" alt=""></strong>&lt;/button>
&lt;button name="cmyk"><strong>&lt;img src="cyan" alt="CMYK">&lt;img src="magenta" alt="">&lt;img src="yellow" alt="">&lt;img src="black" alt=""></strong>&lt;/button></pre>

   <p>Since each image represents one part of the text, it could also
   be written like this:</p>

   <pre>&lt;button name="rgb"><strong>&lt;img src="red" alt="R">&lt;img src="green" alt="G">&lt;img src="blue" alt="B"></strong>&lt;/button>
&lt;button name="cmyk"><strong>&lt;img src="cyan" alt="C">&lt;img src="magenta" alt="M">&lt;img src="yellow" alt="Y">&lt;img src="black" alt="K"></strong>&lt;/button></pre>

   <p>However, with other alternative text, this might not work, and
   putting all the alternative text into one image in each case might
   make more sense:</p>

   <pre>&lt;button name="rgb"><strong>&lt;img src="red" alt="sRGB profile">&lt;img src="green" alt="">&lt;img src="blue" alt=""></strong>&lt;/button>
&lt;button name="cmyk"><strong>&lt;img src="cyan" alt="CMYK profile">&lt;img src="magenta" alt="">&lt;img src="yellow" alt="">&lt;img src="black" alt=""></strong>&lt;/button></pre>

  </div>



  <h6>A phrase or paragraph with an alternative graphical representation: charts, diagrams, graphs, maps, illustrations</h6>

  <p>Sometimes something can be more clearly stated in graphical
  form, for example as a flowchart, a diagram, a graph, or a simple
  map showing directions. In such cases, an image can be given using
  the <code>img</code> element, but the lesser textual version must
  still be given, so that users who are unable to view the image
  (e.g. because they have a very slow connection, or because they
  are using a text-only browser, or because they are listening to
  the page being read out by a hands-free automobile voice Web
  browser, or simply because they are blind) are still able to
  understand the message being conveyed.</p>

  <p>The text must be given in the <code
  title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute, and must convey the
  same message as the image specified in the <code
  title="attr-img-src">src</code> attribute.</p>

  <p>It is important to realize that the alternative text is a
  <em>replacement</em> for the image, not a description of the
  image.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example we have <a
   href="images/parsing-model-overview.png">a flowchart</a> in image
   form, with text in the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
   attribute rephrasing the flowchart in prose form:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>In the common case, the data handled by the tokenization stage
comes from the network, but it can also come from script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p><strong>&lt;img src="images/parsing-model-overview.png" alt="The network
passes data to the Tokenizer stage, which passes data to the Tree
Construction stage. From there, data goes to both the DOM and to
Script Execution. Script Execution is linked to the DOM, and, using
document.write(), passes data to the Tokenizer."></strong>&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here's another example, showing a good solution and a bad
   solution to the problem of including an image in a
   description.</p>

   <p>First, here's the good solution. This sample shows how the
   alternative text should just be what you would have put in the
   prose if the image had never existed.</p>

   <pre>&lt;!-- This is the correct way to do things. -->
&lt;p>
 You are standing in an open field west of a house.
 <strong>&lt;img src="house.jpeg" alt="The house is white, with a boarded front door."></strong>
 There is a small mailbox here.
&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Second, here's the bad solution. In this incorrect way of
   doing things, the alternative text is simply a description of the
   image, instead of a textual replacement for the image. It's bad
   because when the image isn't shown, the text doesn't flow as well
   as in the first example.</p>

   <pre class="bad">&lt;!-- <em>This is the wrong way to do things.</em> -->
&lt;p>
 You are standing in an open field west of a house.
 &lt;img src="house.jpeg" alt="A white house, with a boarded front door.">
 There is a small mailbox here.
&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>Text such as "Photo of white house with boarded door" would be
   equally bad alternative text (though it could be suitable for the
   <code title="attr-title">title</code> attribute or in the
   <code>legend</code> element of a <code>figure</code> with this
   image).</p>

  </div>


  <h6>A short phrase or label with an alternative graphical representation: icons, logos</h6>

  <p>A document can contain information in iconic form. The icon is
  intended to help users of visual browsers to recognize features at
  a glance.</p>

  <p>In some cases, the icon is supplemental to a text label
  conveying the same meaning. In those cases, the <code
  title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must be present but must
  be empty.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here the icons are next to text that conveys the same meaning,
   so they have an empty <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
   attribute:</p>

   <pre>&lt;nav>
 &lt;p>&lt;a href="/help/"><strong>&lt;img src="/icons/help.png" alt=""></strong> Help&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
 &lt;p>&lt;a href="/configure/"><strong>&lt;img src="/icons/configuration.png" alt=""></strong>
 Configuration Tools&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/nav></pre>

  </div>

  <p>In other cases, the icon has no text next to it describing what
  it means; the icon is supposed to be self-explanatory. In those
  cases, an equivalent textual label must be given in the <code
  title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here, posts on a news site are labeled with an icon
   indicating their topic.</p>

   <pre>&lt;body>
 &lt;article>
  &lt;header>
   &lt;h1>Ratatouille wins &lt;i>Best Movie of the Year&lt;/i> award&lt;/h1>
   &lt;p><strong>&lt;img src="movies.png" alt="Movies"></strong>&lt;/p>
  &lt;/header>
  &lt;p>Pixar has won yet another &lt;i>Best Movie of the Year&lt;/i> award,
  making this its 8th win in the last 12 years.&lt;/p>
 &lt;/article>

   &lt;h1>Latest TWiT episode is online&lt;/h1>
   &lt;p><strong>&lt;img src="podcasts.png" alt="Podcasts"></strong>&lt;/p>
  &lt;/header>
  &lt;p>The latest TWiT episode has been posted, in which we hear
  several tech news stories as well as learning much more about the
  iPhone. This week, the panelists compare how reflective their
  iPhones' Apple logos are.&lt;/p>
 &lt;/article>
&lt;/body></pre>

  </div>

  <p>Many pages include logos, insignia, flags, or emblems, which
  stand for a particular entity such as a company, organization,
  project, band, software package, country, or some such.</p>

  <p>If the logo is being used to represent the entity, e.g. as a page
  heading, the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must
  contain the name of the entity being represented by the logo. The
  <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must <em>not</em>
  contain text like the word "logo", as it is not the fact that it is
  a logo that is being conveyed, it's the entity itself.</p>

  <p>If the logo is being used next to the name of the entity that
  it represents, then the logo is supplemental, and its <code
  title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must instead be
  empty.</p>

  <p>If the logo is merely used as decorative material (as branding,
  or, for example, as a side image in an article that mentions the
  entity to which the logo belongs), then the entry below on purely
  decorative images applies. If the logo is actually being
  discussed, then it is being used as a phrase or paragraph (the
  description of the logo) with an alternative graphical
  representation (the logo itself), and the first entry above
  applies.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following snippets, all four of the above cases are
   present. First, we see a logo used to represent a company:</p>

   <pre>&lt;h1><strong>&lt;img src="XYZ.gif" alt="The XYZ company"></strong>&lt;/h1></pre>

   <p>Next, we see a paragraph which uses a logo right next to the
   company name, and so doesn't have any alternative text:

   <pre>&lt;article>
 &lt;h2>News&lt;/h2>
 &lt;p>We have recently been looking at buying the <strong>&lt;img src="alpha.gif"
 alt=""> &Alpha;&Beta;&Gamma; company</strong>, a small Greek company
 specializing in our type of product.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>In this third snippet, we have a logo being used in an aside,
   as part of the larger article discussing the acquisition:</p>

<pre> <strong>&lt;aside>&lt;p>&lt;img src="alpha-large.gif" alt="">&lt;/p>&lt;/aside></strong>
 &lt;p>The &Alpha;&Beta;&Gamma; company has had a good quarter, and our
 pie chart studies of their accounts suggest a much bigger blue slice
 than its green and orange slices, which is always a good sign.&lt;/p>
&lt;/article></pre>

   <p>Finally, we have an opinion piece talking about a logo, and
   the logo is therefore described in detail in the alternative
   text.</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>Consider for a moment their logo:&lt;/p>

<strong>&lt;p>&lt;img src="/images/logo" alt="It consists of a green circle with a
green question mark centered inside it.">&lt;/p></strong>

&lt;p>How unoriginal can you get? I mean, oooooh, a question mark, how
&lt;em>revolutionary&lt;/em>, how utterly &lt;em>ground-breaking&lt;/em>, I'm
sure everyone will rush to adopt those specifications now! They could
at least have tried for some sort of, I don't know, sequence of
rounded squares with varying shades of green and bold white outlines,
at least that would look good on the cover of a blue book.&lt;/p></pre>

   <p>This example shows how the alternative text should be written
   such that if the image isn't <i
   title="img-available">available</i>, and the text is used instead,
   the text flows seamlessly into the surrounding text, as if the
   image had never been there in the first place.</p>

  </div>


  <h6>Text that has been rendered to a graphic for typographical effect</h6>

  <p>Sometimes, an image just consists of text, and the purpose of the
  image is not to highlight the actual typographic effects used to
  render the text, but just to convey the text itself.</p>

  <p>In such cases, the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
  attribute must be present but must consist of the same text as
  written in the image itself.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Consider a graphic containing the text "Earth Day", but with the
   letters all decorated with flowers and plants. If the text is
   merely being used as a heading, to spice up the page for graphical
   users, then the correct alternative text is just the same text
   "Earth Day", and no mention need be made of the decorations:</p>

   <pre>&lt;h1><strong>&lt;img src="earthdayheading.png" alt="Earth Day"></strong>&lt;/h1></pre>

  </div>



  <h6>A graphical representation of some of the surrounding text</h6>

  <p>In many cases, the image is actually just supplementary, and
  its presence merely reinforces the surrounding text. In these
  cases, the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must be
  present but its value must be the empty string.</p>

  <p>In general, an image falls into this category if removing the
  image doesn't make the page any less useful, but including the
  image makes it a lot easier for users of visual browsers to
  understand the concept.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>A flowchart that repeats the previous paragraph in graphical form:</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>The network passes data to the Tokenizer stage, which
passes data to the Tree Construction stage. From there, data goes
to both the DOM and to Script Execution. Script Execution is
linked to the DOM, and, using document.write(), passes data to
the Tokenizer.&lt;/p>
<strong>&lt;p>&lt;img src="images/parsing-model-overview.png" alt="">&lt;/p></strong></pre>

   <p>In these cases, it would be wrong to include alternative text
   that consists of just a caption. If a caption is to be included,
   then either the <code title="attr-title">title</code> attribute can
   be used, or the <code>figure</code> and <code>legend</code>
   elements can be used. In the latter case, the image would in fact
   be a phrase or paragraph with an alternative graphical
   representation, and would thus require alternative text.</p>

   <pre>&lt;!-- Using the title="" attribute -->
&lt;p>The network passes data to the Tokenizer stage, which
passes data to the Tree Construction stage. From there, data goes
to both the DOM and to Script Execution. Script Execution is
linked to the DOM, and, using document.write(), passes data to
the Tokenizer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p><strong>&lt;img src="images/parsing-model-overview.png" alt=""
        title="Flowchart representation of the parsing model."></strong>&lt;/p></pre>

   <pre>&lt;!-- Using &lt;figure> and &lt;legend> -->
&lt;p>The network passes data to the Tokenizer stage, which
passes data to the Tree Construction stage. From there, data goes
to both the DOM and to Script Execution. Script Execution is

&lt;figure>
 <strong>&lt;img src="images/parsing-model-overview.png" alt="The Network leads
 to the Tokenizer, which leads to the Tree Construction. The Tree
 Construction leads to two items. The first is Script Execution, which
 leads via document.write() back to the Tokenizer. The second item
 from which Tree Construction leads is the DOM. The DOM is related to
 the Script Execution."></strong>
 &lt;legend>Flowchart representation of the parsing model.&lt;/legend>
&lt;/figure></pre>

   <pre class="bad">&lt;!-- This is WRONG. Do not do this. Instead, do what the above examples do. -->
&lt;p>The network passes data to the Tokenizer stage, which

<strong>&lt;p>&lt;img src="rendering-mode-pie-chart.png" alt="">&lt;/p></strong></pre>

  <h6>A purely decorative image that doesn't add any information</h6>

  <p>In general, if an image is decorative but isn't especially
  page-specific, for example an image that forms part of a site-wide
  design scheme, the image should be specified in the site's CSS,
  not in the markup of the document.</p>

  <p>However, a decorative image that isn't discussed by the
  surrounding text still has some relevance can be included in a page
  using the <code>img</code> element. Such images are decorative, but
  still form part of the content. In these cases, the <code
  title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must be present but its
  value must be the empty string.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Examples where the image is purely decorative despite being
   relevant would include things like a photo of the Black Rock City
   landscape in a blog post about an event at Burning Man, or an
   image of a painting inspired by a poem, on a page reciting that
   poem. The following snippet shows an example of the latter
   case (only the first verse is included in this snippet):</p>

   <pre>&lt;h1>The Lady of Shalott&lt;/h1>
<strong>&lt;p>&lt;img src="shalott.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p></strong>
&lt;p>On either side the river lie&lt;br>
Long fields of barley and of rye,&lt;br>
That clothe the wold and meet the sky;&lt;br>
And through the field the road run by&lt;br>
To many-tower'd Camelot;&lt;br>
And up and down the people go,&lt;br>
Gazing where the lilies blow&lt;br>
Round an island there below,&lt;br>
The island of Shalott.&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>



  <h6>A group of images that form a single larger picture with no links</h6>

  <p>When a picture has been sliced into smaller image files that are
  then displayed together to form the complete picture again, one of
  the images must have its <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
  attribute set as per the relevant rules that would be appropriate
  for the picture as a whole, and then all the remaining images must
  have their <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute set to
  the empty string.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, a picture representing a company logo
   for <span title="">XYZ Corp</span> has been split into two pieces,
   the first containing the letters "XYZ" and the second with the word
   "Corp". The alternative text ("XYZ Corp") is all in the first
   image.</p>

   <pre>&lt;h1><strong>&lt;img src="logo1.png" alt="XYZ Corp">&lt;img src="logo2.png" alt=""></strong>&lt;/h1></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, a rating is shown as three filled
   stars and two empty stars. While the alternative text could have
   been "&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2606;&#x2606;", the author has
   instead decided to more helpfully give the rating in the form "3
   out of 5". That is the alternative text of the first image, and the
   rest have blank alternative text.</p>

   <pre>&lt;p>Rating: &lt;meter max=5 value=3><strong>&lt;img src="1" alt="3 out of 5"
  >&lt;img src="1" alt="">&lt;img src="1" alt="">&lt;img src="0" alt=""
  >&lt;img src="0" alt=""></strong>&lt;/meter>&lt;/p></pre>

  </div>



  <h6>A group of images that form a single larger picture with links</h6>

  <p>Generally, <span title="image map">image maps</span> should be
  used instead of slicing an image for links.</p>

  <p>However, if an image is indeed sliced and any of the components
  of the sliced picture are the sole contents of links, then one image
  per link must have alternative text in its <code
  title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute representing the purpose
  of the link.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, a picture representing the flying
   spaghetti monster emblem, with each of the left noodly appendages
   and the right noodly appendages in different images, so that the
   user can pick the left side or the right side in an adventure.</p>

   <pre>&lt;h1>The Church&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>You come across a flying spaghetti monster. Which side of His
Noodliness do you wish to reach out for?&lt;/p>
<strong>&lt;p>&lt;a href="?go=left" >&lt;img src="fsm-left.png"  alt="Left side. ">&lt;/a
  >&lt;img src="fsm-middle.png" alt=""
  >&lt;a href="?go=right">&lt;img src="fsm-right.png" alt="Right side.">&lt;/a>&lt;/p></strong></pre>

  </div>



  <h6>A key part of the content</h6>

  <p>In some cases, the image is a critical part of the
  content. This could be the case, for instance, on a page that is
  part of a photo gallery. The image is the whole <em>point</em> of
  the page containing it.</p>

  <p>How to provide alternative text for an image that is a key part
  of the content depends on the image's provenance.</p>

  <dl>

   <dt>The general case</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>When it is possible for detailed alternative text to be
    provided, for example if the image is part of a series of
    screenshots in a magazine review, or part of a comic strip, or is
    a photograph in a blog entry about that photograph, text that can
    serve as a substitute for the image must be given as the contents
    of the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>A screenshot in a gallery of screenshots for a new OS, with
     some alternative text:</p>

     <pre>&lt;figure>
 <strong>&lt;img src="KDE%20Light%20desktop.png"
      alt="The desktop is blue, with icons along the left hand side in
           two columns, reading System, Home, K-Mail, etc. A window is
           open showing that menus wrap to a second line if they
           cannot fit in the window. The window has a list of icons
           along the top, with an address bar below it, a list of
           icons for tabs along the left edge, a status bar on the
           bottom, and two panes in the middle. The desktop has a bar
           at the bottom of the screen with a few buttons, a pager, a
           list of open applications, and a clock."></strong>
 &lt;legend>Screenshot of a KDE desktop.&lt;/legend>
&lt;/figure></pre>

    </div>

    <div class="example">

     <p>A graph in a financial report:</p>

     <pre><strong>&lt;img src="sales.gif"

     with each year: 624%, 75%, 138%, 40%, 35%, 9%, 21%"></strong></pre>

     <p>Note that "sales graph" would be inadequate alternative text
     for a sales graph. Text that would be a good <em>caption</em> is
     not generally suitable as replacement text.</p>

    </div>

   </dd>


   <dt>Images that defy a complete description</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>In certain cases, the nature of the image might be such that
    providing thorough alternative text is impractical. For example,
    the image could be indistinct, or could be a complex fractal, or
    could be a detailed topographical map.</p>

    <p>In these cases, the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
    attribute must contain some suitable alternative text, but it may
    be somewhat brief.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>Sometimes there simply is no text that can do justice to an
     image. For example, there is little that can be said to usefully
     describe a Rorschach inkblot test. However, a description, even
     if brief, is still better than nothing:</p>

     <pre>&lt;figure>
 <strong>&lt;img src="/commons/a/a7/Rorschach1.jpg" alt="A shape with left-right
 symmetry with indistinct edges, with a small gap in the center, two
 larger gaps offset slightly from the center, with two similar gaps
 under them. The outline is wider in the top half than the bottom
 half, with the sides extending upwards higher than the center, and
 the center extending below the sides."></strong>
 &lt;legend>A black outline of the first of the ten cards
 in the Rorschach inkblot test.&lt;/legend>
&lt;/figure></pre>

     <p>Note that the following would be a very bad use of alternative
     text:</p>

     <pre class="bad">&lt;!-- This example is wrong. Do not copy it. -->
&lt;figure>
 &lt;img src="/commons/a/a7/Rorschach1.jpg" alt="A black outline
 of the first of the ten cards in the Rorschach inkblot test.">
 &lt;legend>A black outline of the first of the ten cards
 in the Rorschach inkblot test.&lt;/legend>
&lt;/figure></pre>

     <p>Including the caption in the alternative text like this isn't
     useful because it effectively duplicates the caption for users
     who don't have images, taunting them twice yet not helping them
     any more than if they had only read or heard the caption
     once.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="example">

     <p>Another example of an image that defies full description is a
     fractal, which, by definition, is infinite in complexity.</p>

     <p>The following example shows one possible way of providing
     alternative text for the full view of an image of the Mandelbrot
     set.</p>

     <pre><strong>&lt;img src="ms1.jpeg" alt="The Mandelbrot set appears as a cardioid with
its cusp on the real axis in the positive direction, with a smaller
bulb aligned along the same center line, touching it in the negative
direction, and with these two shapes being surrounded by smaller bulbs
of various sizes."></strong></pre>

    </div>

   </dd>


   <dt id="unknown-images">Images whose contents are not known</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>In some unfortunate cases, there might be no alternative text
    available at all, either because the image is obtained in some
    automated fashion without any associated alternative text (e.g. a
    Webcam), or because the page is being generated by a script using
    user-provided images where the user did not provide suitable or
    usable alternative text (e.g. photograph sharing sites), or
    because the author does not himself know what the images represent
    (e.g. a blind photographer sharing an image on his blog).</p>

    <p>In such cases, the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
    attribute's value may be omitted, but one of the following
    conditions must be met as well:</p>

    <ul>

     <li>The <code title="attr-title">title</code> attribute is
     present and has a non-empty value.</li>

     <li>The <code>img</code> element is in a <code>figure</code>
     element that contains a <code>legend</code> element that contains
     content other than <span>inter-element whitespace</span>.</li>

     <li>The <code>img</code> element is part of the only
     <span>paragraph</span> directly in its <span
     title="concept-section">section</span>, and is the only
     <code>img</code> element without an <code
     title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute in its section, and its
     <span title="concept-section">section</span> has an associated
     heading.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="note">Such cases are to be kept to an absolute
    minimum. If there is even the slightest possibility of the author
    having the ability to provide real alternative text, then it would
    not be acceptable to omit the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code>
    attribute.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>A photo on a photo-sharing site, if the site received the
     image with no metadata other than the caption:</p>

     <pre>&lt;figure>
 <strong>&lt;img src="1100670787_6a7c664aef.jpg"></strong>
 &lt;legend>Bubbles traveled everywhere with us.&lt;/legend>
&lt;/figure></pre>

     <p>It could also be marked up like this:</p>

     <pre>&lt;article>
 &lt;h1>Bubbles traveled everywhere with us.&lt;/h1>
 <strong>&lt;img src="1100670787_6a7c664aef.jpg"></strong>
&lt;/article></pre>

     <p>In either case, though, it would be better if a detailed
     description of the important parts of the image obtained from the
     user and included on the page.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="example">

     <p>A blind user's blog in which a photo taken by the user is
     shown. Initially, the user might not have any idea what the photo
     he took shows:</p>

     <pre>&lt;article>
 &lt;h1>I took a photo&lt;/h1>
 &lt;p>I went out today and took a photo!&lt;/p>
 &lt;figure>
  <strong>&lt;img src="photo2.jpeg"></strong>
  &lt;legend>A photograph taken blindly from my front porch.&lt;/legend>
 &lt;/figure>
&lt;/article></pre>

     <p>Eventually though, the user might obtain a description of the
     image from his friends and could then include alternative text:</p>

     <pre>&lt;article>
 &lt;h1>I took a photo&lt;/h1>
 &lt;p>I went out today and took a photo!&lt;/p>
 &lt;figure>
  <strong>&lt;img src="photo2.jpeg" alt="The photograph shows my hummingbird
  feeder hanging from the edge of my roof. It is half full, but there
  are no birds around. In the background, out-of-focus trees fill the
  shot. The feeder is made of wood with a metal grate, and it contains
  peanuts. The edge of the roof is wooden too, and is painted white
  with light blue streaks."></strong>
  &lt;legend>A photograph taken blindly from my front porch.&lt;/legend>
 &lt;/figure>
&lt;/article></pre>

    </div>

    <div class="example">

     <p>Sometimes the entire point of the image is that a textual
     description is not available, and the user is to provide the
     description. For instance, the point of a CAPTCHA image is to see
     if the user can literally read the graphic. Here is one way to
     mark up a CAPTCHA (note the <code title="attr-title">title</code>
     attribute):</p>

     <pre>&lt;p>&lt;label>What does this image say?
<strong>&lt;img src="captcha.cgi?id=8934" title="CAPTCHA"></strong>
&lt;input type=text name=captcha>&lt;/label>
(If you cannot see the image, you can use an &lt;a
href="?audio">audio&lt;/a> test instead.)&lt;/p></pre>

     <p>Another example would be software that displays images and
     asks for alternative text precisely for the purpose of then
     writing a page with correct alternative text. Such a page could
     have a table of images, like this:</p>

     <pre>&lt;table>
 &lt;thead>
  &lt;tr> &lt;th> Image &lt;th> Description
 &lt;tbody>
  &lt;tr>
   &lt;td> <strong>&lt;img src="2421.png" title="Image 640 by 100, filename 'banner.gif'"></strong>
   &lt;td> &lt;input name="alt2421">
  &lt;tr>
   &lt;td> <strong>&lt;img src="2422.png" title="Image 200 by 480, filename 'ad3.gif'"></strong>
   &lt;td> &lt;input name="alt2422">
&lt;/table></pre>

     <p>Notice that even in this example, as much useful information
     as possible is still included in the <code
     title="attr-title">title</code> attribute.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="note">Since some users cannot use images at all
    (e.g. because they have a very slow connection, or because they
    are using a text-only browser, or because they are listening to
    the page being read out by a hands-free automobile voice Web
    browser, or simply because they are blind), the <code
    title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute is only allowed to be
    omitted rather than being provided with replacement text when no
    alternative text is available and none can be made available, as
    in the above examples. Lack of effort from the part of the author
    is not an acceptable reason for omitting the <code
    title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute.</p>

  <h6>An image not intended for the user</h6>

  <p>Generally authors should avoid using <code>img</code> elements
  for purposes other than showing images.</p>

  <p>If an <code>img</code> element is being used for purposes other
  than showing an image, e.g. as part of a service to count page
  views, then the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must
  be the empty string.</p>

  <p>In such cases, the <code title="attr-dim-width">width</code> and
  <code title="attr-dim-height">height</code> attributes should both
  be set to zero.</p>



  <h6>An image in an e-mail or private document intended for a specific person who is known to be able to view images</h6>

  <p><i>This section does not apply to documents that are publicly
  accessible, or whose target audience is not necessarily personally
  known to the author, such as documents on a Web site, e-mails sent
  to public mailing lists, or software documentation.</i></p>

  <p>When an image is included in a private communication (such as an
  HTML e-mail) aimed at a specific person who is known to be able to
  view images, the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute may
  be omitted. However, even in such cases it is strongly recommended
  that alternative text be included (as appropriate according to the
  kind of image involved, as described in the above entries), so that
  the e-mail is still usable should the user use a mail client that
  does not support images, or should the document be forwarded on to
  other users whose abilities might not include easily seeing
  images.</p>



  <h6>General guidelines</h6>

  <p>The most general rule to consider when writing alternative text
  is the following: <strong>the intent is that replacing every image
  with the text of its <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute
  not change the meaning of the page</strong>.</p>

  <p>So, in general, alternative text can be written by considering
  what one would have written had one not been able to include the
  image.</p>

  <p>A corollary to this is that the <code
  title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute's value should never
  contain text that could be considered the image's <em>caption</em>,
  <em>title</em>, or <em>legend</em>. It is supposed to contain
  replacement text that could be used by users <em>instead</em> of the
  image; it is not meant to supplement the image. The <code
  title="attr-title">title</code> attribute can be used for
  supplemental information.</p>

  <p class="note">One way to think of alternative text is to think
  about how you would read the page containing the image to someone
  over the phone, without mentioning that there is an image
  present. Whatever you say instead of the image is typically a good
  start for writing the alternative text.</p>

  <h6>Guidance for markup generators</h6>

  <p>Markup generators (such as WYSIWYG authoring tools) should,
  wherever possible, obtain alternative text from their
  users. However, it is recognized that in many cases, this will not
  be possible.</p>

  <p>For images that are the sole contents of links, markup generators
  should examine the link target to determine the title of the target,
  or the URL of the target, and use information obtained in this
  manner as the alternative text.</p>

  <p>As a last resort, implementors should either set the <code
  title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute to the empty string, under
  the assumption that the image is a purely decorative image that
  doesn't add any information but is still specific to the surrounding
  content, or omit the <code title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute
  altogether, under the assumption that the image is a key part of the
  content.</p>

  <p>Markup generators should generally avoid using the image's own
  file name as the alternative text.</p>

  <h6>Guidance for conformance checkers</h6>

  <p>Conformance checkers must report the lack of an <code
  title="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute as an error unless the
  conditions listed above for <a href="#unknown-images">images whose
  contents are not known</a> or they have been configured to assume
  that the document is an e-mail or document intended for a specific
  person who is known to be able to view images.</p>
