  <h2>
   Extensions to the HTML5 Syntax
  </h2>
  <p>
   <em>This section is normative.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    There are a few changes that are required to the HTML5 specification in
    order to fully support RDFa. The following sub-sections outline the
    necessary modifications to the base HTML5 specification.
  </p>

  <h3>The RDFa Attributes and Valid Values</h3>

  <p>
    All RDFa attributes and valid values (including CURIEs), as listed in 
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/#rdfa-attributes">Section 2.1: The RDFa Attributes</a>, 
    are conforming when used in an HTML5 or XHTML5 document.
  </p>

  <h3>Conformance Criteria for <code>xmlns:</code>-Prefixed Attributes</h3>

  <p class="XXX">
   While this section outlines xmlns: conformance criteria for HTML+RDFa, 
   the support for distributed extensibility in non-XML mode HTML5  
   (using xmlns and xmlns:) is still an open issue. This section may be 
   further modified before Last Call based on progress made on the 
   distributed extensibility issue.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since RDFa uses attributes starting with <code>xmlns:</code> to 
    specify CURIE prefixes, it is
    important that any attribute starting with a case-insensitive match on
    the text string "<code>xmlns:</code>" be preserved in the DOM or other
    tree-like model that is passed to the RDFa Processor. While it is specified
    that HTML5 must preserve these attributes in the DOM, it must also accept 
    these attributes as conforming in non-XML HTML5. For documents conforming 
    to this specification, attributes with names that have the case 
    insensitive prefix "<code>xmlns:</code>" are conforming in both HTML5 and
    XHTML5.
  </p>

  <h3>Preserving Namespaces via Coercion to Infoset</h3>

  <p class="XXX">
    This section needs feedback from the user agent vendors to ensure that
    this feature does not conflict with user agent architecture and has
    no technical reason that it cannot be implemented.
  </p>

  <p>
    RDFa is currently dependent on the <code>xmlns:</code> pattern to declare 
    prefix mappings, it is imperative that namespace information that is 
    declared in non-XML mode HTML5 documents are mapped to an Infoset correctly.
    In order to ensure this mapping is performed correctly, the 
    "Coercing an HTML DOM into an infoset" rules defined in 
    [<a href="refsHTML5">HTML5</a>] must be modified to include the following 
    rule: 
  </p>

  <p>
    If the XML API is namespace-aware, the tool must ensure that proper 
    ([<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/#infoitem.attribute">namespace name</a>], [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/#infoitem.attribute">local name</a>], [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/#infoitem.attribute">normalized value</a>]) namespace tuples are created when converting the non-XML mode DOM into an Infoset.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, given the following input text:

    <pre>
       &lt;div xmlns:audio="http://purl.org/media/audio#"&gt;
    </pre>

    The <code>div</code> element above, when coerced from an HTML DOM into
    an Infoset, should contain an attribute in the
    [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/#infoitem.element">namespace attributes</a>] list with a [namespace name] set to "<code>http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/</code>", a [local name] set to
    <code>audio</code>, and a [normalized value] of 
    "<code>http://purl.org/media/audio#</code>".
