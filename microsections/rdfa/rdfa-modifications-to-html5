   Modifications to HTML5

   <em>This section is normative.</em>

  <p>
    There are a few changes that are required to the HTML5 specification in
    order to fully support RDFa. The following sub-sections outline the
    necessary modifications to the base HTML5 specification.
  </p>

  <h3>Preservation of the <code>profile</code> keyword in <code>rel</code> attributes</h3>
  <p>
    In order to provide a language version signalling mechanism, the 
    <code>profile</code> keyword is provided for use in <code>rel</code>
    attributes embedded in <code>link</code> elements. 
  </p>

  <h3>Preservation and Validation of <code>xmlns:</code></h3>

  <p>
    Since RDFa uses <code>xmlns:</code> to specify CURIE prefixes, it is
    important that any attribute starting with a case-insensitive match on
    the text string <code>xmlns:</code> be preserved in the DOM or other
    tree-like model that is passed to the RDFa Processor. It is also
    necessary that when validating non-XML mode documents that the validator
    must not generate a warning for attributes starting with 
    <code>xmlns:</code>.
  </p>
