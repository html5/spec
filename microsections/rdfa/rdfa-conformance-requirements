  <h4>
   Conformance Requirements
  </h4>
  <p>
   <em>This section is normative.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [<a class="nref"
      href="#ref_RFC2119">RFC2119</a>].
  </p>
  <h5>
   Document Conformance
  </h5>
  <p>
   In order for a document to claim that it is a conforming HTML+RDFa document,
   it must provide the facilities described as mandatory in this section.
   The document conformance criteria are listed below, of which only a subset
   are mandatory:
  </p>

  <ol>
   <li>
    There should be a DOCTYPE declaration specified prior to the root element
    in the document that follows the conventions outlined in the 
    <span>The DOCTYPE</span> section.
   </li>
   <li>
    The root element of the document must follow the conventions outlined
    in <span>The root element</span> section.
   </li>
   <li>
    There may be a <code>link</code> element contained in the 
    <code>head</code> element that contains <code>profile</code> for
    the the <code>rel</code> attribute and 
    <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab</code> for the <code>href</code>
    attribute.
    <div class="XXX">
     This requires the HTML5 spec to add <code>profile</code> to the list of
     allow-able <code>rel</code>-values. This is used as the signalling 
     mechansim for an RDFa document because the <code>profile</code> 
     attribute is deprecated in HTML5.
    </div>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <h5>
   User Agent Conformance
  </h5>
  <p>
   A conforming RDFa user agent must:
   <ul>
   <li>
    Conform to all conformance requirements listed in the 
    "Conformance requirements" section of the HTML5 specification.
   </li>
   <li>
    Implement all of the features required in the RDFa section of the 
    HTML5 specification.
   </li>
   <li>
    Implement all of the features specified in the XHTML+RDFa specification, 
    excluding those features which are specifically overridden by the RDFa 
    section of the HTML5 specification.
   </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <h5>
   RDFa Processor Conformance
  </h5>
  <p>
   A conforming RDFa Processor must implement all of the mandatory features 
   specified in the XHTML+RDFa specification. It must also support any
   mandatory features specified in the RDFa section of the HTML5 specification.
  </p>
