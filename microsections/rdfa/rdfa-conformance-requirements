   Document Conformance
  </h3>
  
  <p>
   In order for a document to claim that it is a conforming HTML+RDFa document,
   it must provide the facilities described as mandatory in this section.
   The document conformance criteria are listed below, of which only a subset
   are mandatory:
  </p>

  <ol>

    specification must be met.
   </li>
   <li>
    There should be a <code>version</code> attribute on the <code>html</code>
    element. The value of the <code>version</code> attribute should be
    "HTML+RDFa 1.0" if the document is a non-XML mode document, or 
    "XHTML+RDFa 1.0" if the document is a XML mode document.
   </li>
   <li>
    There may be a <code>link</code> element contained in the 
    <code>head</code> element that contains <code>profile</code> for
    the the <code>rel</code> attribute and 
    <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab</code> for the <code>href</code>
    attribute.
