  <h4>
   Document Conformance
  </h4>
  <p>
   In order for a document to claim that it is a conforming HTML+RDFa document,
   it must provide the facilities described as mandatory in this section.
   The document conformance criteria are listed below, of which only a subset
   are mandatory:
  </p>

  <ol>
   <li>
    There should be a DOCTYPE declaration specified prior to the root element
    in the document that follows the conventions outlined in the
    "The DOCTYPE section" of the HTML5 specification.
    <div class="XXX">
     This item may be removed once this document is integrated with the
     HTML5 specification. It is currently included for the purposes of
     clarifying the full set of Document Conformance requirements for 
     an HTML5+RDFa document.
    </div>
   </li>
   <li>
    The root element of the document must follow the conventions outlined
    in "The root element" section of the HTML5 specification.
    <div class="XXX">
     This item may be removed once this document is integrated with the
     HTML5 specification. It is currently included for the purposes of
     clarifying the full set of Document Conformance requirements for 
     an HTML5+RDFa document.
    </div>
   </li>
   <li>
    There may be a <code>link</code> element contained in the 
    <code>head</code> element that contains <code>profile</code> for
    the the <code>rel</code> attribute and 
    <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab</code> for the <code>href</code>
    attribute.
    <div class="XXX">
     This requires the HTML5 spec to add <code>profile</code> to the list of
     allow-able <code>rel</code>-values. This is used as the signalling 
     mechansim for an RDFa document because the <code>profile</code> 
     attribute is deprecated in HTML5.
    </div>
    <div class="XXX">
     There has also been strong support from the RDFa Task Force that the 
     <code>profile</code> attribute should be retained in HTML5, as it
     provides an "out-of-band" mechanism for signaling that the document
     contains RDFa. The <code>profile</code> attribute may also be used 
     extensively to provide 
     [<a href="http://rdfa.info/wiki/RDFa_Profiles">RDFa Profiles</a>] support.
     Adding <code>profile</code> to the list of <code>rel</code> values
     and using it to signal that the document contains RDFa places document
     processing instructions into the RDF graph, which is problematic.
    </div>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <h4>
   User Agent Conformance
  </h4>
  <p>
   A conforming RDFa user agent must:
   <ul>
   <li>
    Conform to all conformance requirements listed in the 
    "Conformance requirements" section of the HTML5 specification.
   </li>
   <li>
    Implement all of the features required in the RDFa section of the 
    HTML5 specification.
   </li>
   <li>
    Implement all of the features specified in the XHTML+RDFa specification, 
    excluding those features which are specifically overridden by the RDFa 
    section of the HTML5 specification.
   </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <h4>
   RDFa Processor Conformance
  </h4>
  <p>
   A conforming RDFa Processor must implement all of the mandatory features 
   specified in the XHTML+RDFa specification. It must also support any
   mandatory features specified in the RDFa section of the HTML5 specification.
  </p>
