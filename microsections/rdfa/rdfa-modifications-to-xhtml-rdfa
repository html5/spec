  <h2>
   Modifications to XHTML+RDFa
  </h2>
  <p>
   <em>This section is normative.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
   The [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/">XHTML+RDFa</a>]
   Recommendation is the base document on which this specification builds. 
   XHTML+RDFa specifies the attributes and processing rules for extracting
   RDF from an XHTML document. This section specifies changes to the
   attributes and processing rules defined in XHTML+RDFa in order to
   support extracting RDF from HTML documents.
  </p>

  <h3>Specifying the language for a literal</h3>
  <p>
   The <code>lang</code> attribute must be supported in the same manner 
   as the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute is in the XHTML+RDFa specification.
   The precedence rules for selecting which value overrides the other is
   outlined in the section titled "The lang and xml:lang attributes" in
   the HTML5 specification.
  </p>
  <p>
   If an author is unsure of the final encapsulating DOCTYPE for their
   markup, such as HTML5 vs. XHTML5, it is suggested that the author specify
   both <code>lang</code> and <code>xml:lang</code> where the value in
   both attributes is exactly the same.
  </p>

  <h3>Invalid XMLLiteral values</h3>
  <p>
   When generating literals of type XMLLiteral, the processor must ensure that
   the output XMLLiteral is 
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#dt-wellformed">well-formed XML</a>. 
   If the input is not well-formed XML</a>, the processor must transform
   the input text in a way that generates well-formed XML. An RDFa Processor
   that is transforming not well-formed XML to well-formed XML must use the
   algorithm for serializing a DOM subtree into XHTML5 as specified in the
   HTML5 specification.
  </p>
  <p>
   Transformation to well-formed XML is required because an application
   that consumes XMLLiteral data expects that data to be well-formed.
  </p>
  <p>
   The transformation requirement does not apply to input data that are
   text-only, such as literals that contain a <code>datatype</code> attribute
   with an empty value (<code>""</code>), or input data that that contain
   only text nodes.
  </p>

  <h3>The <code>xmlns:</code> attribute</h3>
  <p>
   CURIE prefix mappings specified using <code>xmlns:</code>
   must be processed using the rules specified in the
   [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">Namespaces in XML</a>]
   Recommendation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since CURIE prefix mappings have been specified using <code>xmlns:</code>, 
   and since HTML attribute names are case-insensitive, CURIE prefix names 
   declared using the <code>xmlns:</code>attribute-name pattern 
   <code>xmlns:&lt;PREFIX&gt;="&lt;URI&gt;"</code> should be specified
   using only lower-case characters. For example, the text "xmlns:" and the
   text in "&lt;PREFIX&gt;" should be lower-case only. This is to ensure that 
   prefix mappings are interpreted in the same way between HTML 
   (case-insensitive attribute names) and XHTML (case-sensitive attribute
   names) document types.
  </p>
