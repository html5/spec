  Today's web is built predominantly for human consumption. Even as machine-readable data begins to permeate the web, it is typically distributed in a separate file, with a separate format, and very limited correspondence between the human and machine versions. As a result, web browsers can provide only minimal assistance to humans in parsing and processing web data: browsers only see presentation information. RDFa is intended to solve the problem of machine-readable data in HTML documents. RDFa provides a set of HTML attributes to augment visual data with machine-readable hints. Using RDFa, authors may turn their existing human-visible text and links into machine-readable data without repeating content.

   History
  </h3>

  <p>
   In early 2004, Mark Birbeck published a document named
   [<a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2004/02/xhtml-rdf.html">XHTML and RDF</a>]
   via the XHTML2 Working Group wherein he laid the groundwork for what 
   would eventually become RDFa (The Resource Description Framework in 
   Attributes).
  <p>
   In 2006, the work was co-sponsored by the Semantic Web Deployment Work Group,
   which began to formalize a technology to express semantic data in 
   XHTML. This technology was successfully developed and reached consensus
   at the W3C, later published as an official W3C Recommendation.
   While HTML provides a mechanism to express the structure of a 
   document (title, paragraphs, links), RDFa provides a mechanism to express 
   the meaning in a document (people, places, events).
  <p>
  <p>
   The document, titled "RDF in XHTML: Syntax and Processing" 
   [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/">XHTML+RDFa</a>], defined
   a set of attributes and rules for processing those attributes that
   resulted in the output of machine-readable semantic data. While the
   document applied to XHTML, the attributes and rules were always 
   intended to operate across any tree-based structure containing attributes 
   on tree nodes (such as HTML4, SVG and ODF).
  </p>
  <p>
   While RDFa was initially specified for use in XHTML, adoption by
   a number of large organizations on the Web spurred RDFa's use in non-XHTML
   languages. Its use in HTML4, before an official specification 
   was developed for those languages, caused concern regarding document
   conformance.
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the years, the members of the RDFa Task Force 
   [<a href="http://rdfa.info/">RDFaTF</a>] had discussed the possibility 
   of applying the same attributes and processing rules outlined in the 
   XHTML+RDFa specification to all HTML family documents. By design, the 
   possibility of a unified semantic data expression mechanism between all 
   HTML and XHTML family documents was squarely in the realm of possibility.
  </p>
  <p>
   This section describes the modifications to the original XHTML+RDFa
   specification that permit the use of RDFa in all HTML family documents.
   By using the attributes and processing rules described in the 
   XHTML+RDFa specification and heeding the minor changes in this 
   section, authors can expect to generate markup that produces the same
   semantic data output in HTML4, HTML5 and XHTML5.
