  <p>
   Section 5 of the
   [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/">XHTML+RDFa</a>] specification
   defines a generic processing model for extracting RDF from a
   tree-based model. The method of transforming an input document into a
   model suited for the RDFa processing rules is intentionally not defined
   in the XHTML+RDFa specification. The method of transformation was intended
   to be defined in the implementation language, in this case, this section of
   the HTML+RDFa specification.
  </p>
  <p>
   The HTML5 and XHTML5 DOMs are each a super-set of the tree-based model
   on which the RDFa processing rules operate. Therefore, a mapping mechanism 
   to translate from a DOM to a tree-model is not necessary.
   The HTML5 and XHTML5 DOM, or equivalent data structure, should be used 
   as input to the RDFa processing rules. The normative language for
   construction of the HTML5 DOM and XHTML5 DOM is contained in the HTML5
   specification.
  </p>
  <h3>Modifying the Input Document</h3>
  <p>
   <em>This section is informative.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
   RDFa's tree-based processing rules enable an input document to be 
   automatically corrected, cleaned-up, re-arranged, or modified in any
   way that is approved by the host language. For example, element nesting 
   issues in HTML documents may be corrected before the input document is 
   translated into the DOM, a valid tree-based model, on which the 
   RDFa processing rules will operate.
  </p>
  <p>
   Any mechanism that generates a data structure equivalent to the HTML5 or 
   XHTML5 DOM, such as the html5lib library, may be used as the mechanism to
   construct the tree-based model provided as input to the RDFa processing 
   rules.
