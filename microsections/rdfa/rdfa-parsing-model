  <h2>
   Parsing Model
  </h2>
  <p>
   Section 5 of the
   [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/">XHTML+RDFa</a>] specification
   defines a generic processing model for extracting RDF from a
   tree-based model. The method of transforming an input document into a
   model suited for the RDFa processing rules is intentionally not defined
   in the XHTML+RDFa specification. The method of transformation was intended
   to be defined in the implementation language, in this case, this section of
   the HTML5 specification.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the context of the HTML5 specification, the parsing rules for an input 
   document in HTML4 and HTML5 are clearly defined. The processing model 
   defined in Section 5 of the XHTML+RDFa specification should be executed 
   on the HTML5 DOM. While the HTML5 DOM is not currently stable, any 
   mechanism that generates a valid HTML5 DOM, such as the html5lib library,
   may provide a mechanism that is guaranteed to eventually provide a 
   stable, tree-based model for the RDFa processing rules.
  </p>
  <p>
   RDFa's tree-based processing rules enable an input document to be 
   automatically corrected, cleaned-up, re-arranged, or modified in any
   way that is approved by the host language. For example, element nesting 
   issues in HTML documents may be corrected before the input document is 
   serialized into the tree-based model on which the RDFa processing rules 
   will operate.
