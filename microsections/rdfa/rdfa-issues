    This section outlines a number of editorial issues with the RDFa 
    section of the HTML5 specification.
  </p>
  <p class="XXX">
   In order to provide a module that can be authored, inserted and moved
   easily within the HTML5 specification, the RDFa specification section is 
   being edited separately from the main HTML5 specification source file.
   There are two documents that are generated from the RDFa specification 
   source. The first is the full HTML5 specification, which includes the 
   RDFa specification section. The second is the stand-alone HTML5+RDFa 
   document.
  </p>
  <p class="XXX">
   The upside to having two documents generated from the same source mainly
   has to do with load-times for the HTML5 specification in web browsers.
   Loading the 4MB HTML5 specification can be very slow, even in Firefox 
   3.5 or Chrome. So for those that want to just look at the RDFa specification
   text, there is a much smaller, separate document for that purpose.
  </p>
  <p class="XXX">
   Unfortunately, there are a number of down-sides with this approach. The
   first is that the specification language becomes more verbose. The second
   is that cross-references within the HTML5 document are impossible due to
   a bug/feature in the Anolis specification processor. 
  <p class="XXX">
   These down-sides are not ideal and will eventually be remedied as we find
   a way to either fix Anolis or no longer support the smaller, standalone 
   HTML5+RDFa document.
